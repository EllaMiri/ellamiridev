          During my front end education I've created a wide variety of projects
          ranging from games to webshops <br /> and full stack applications with
          user registration and login using MongoDB. <br /> Here I've put them
          together along with projects I've created on my freetime for you to
          view and try the demos.

          My goal as a developer is to create websites / applications that are
          easy to use, visually appealing and has a purpose. <br /> I focus a
          lot on the user experience since the users are the reason the
          application exists.

              A page for adopting cats and dogs where the user can create a post
              saying for example they want to adopt an animal or that they've
              found an animal that needs a new home. To create a post you will
              have to create an account and then login. You can edit your own
              post as well as delete it, but not anyone elses. This project is
              built using React and Bootstrap for the front end and Node,
              Express.JS and Mongoose for the back end using MongoDB database.
              MongoDB compass was used for viewing the database. All the created
              accounts and posts are stored in the database. We focused a lot on
              security, we have middlewares for authentication and also
              encrypted the passwords using Bcrypt. We also used
              coookie-session. A school project made together with 2 classmates.
