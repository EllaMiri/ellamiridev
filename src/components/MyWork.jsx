          During my front end education I've created a wide variety of projects
          ranging from games to webshops <br /> and full stack applications with
          user registration and login using MongoDB. <br /> Here I've put them
          together along with projects I've created on my freetime for you to
          view and try the demos.

          My goal as a developer is to create websites / applications that are
          easy to use, visually appealing and has a purpose. <br /> I focus a
          lot on the user experience since the users are the reason the
          application exists.
